# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
##Overview

This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a machine learning project.
The goal is to understand the dataset, identify patterns, relationships, and prepare data for modeling.

EDA Highlights

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Visualization: Plotted histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Created new features, transformed variables, and applied scaling.

Statistical Analysis: Conducted hypothesis testing and calculated summary statistics.
